# React Crypto Lookup

### Summary
This is a cryptocurrency search single-page-application(SPA) bootstrapped with Create React App.  The project uses [React Window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window), and [React Virtualized's standalone AutoSizer component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-virtualized-auto-sizer).  This project also utilizes [Material UI](https://mui.com/) (MUI) for styling.

### Technical details
The SPA is built on [Binance's](https://www.binance.com/en) free cryptocurrency market data API and allows the user to search for any cryptocurrency listed within Binance's exchange to view current pricing information.  The SPA allows users to add any of the cryptocurrencies to a favorites list.
